# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records significant architectural decisions made during
the development of the `i3cex` package.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a short document capturing a single
design decision, its context, the alternatives considered, the chosen
option, and its consequences. ADRs are **immutable** — once accepted,
they are never edited. If a decision is superseded, a new ADR is
written that references and supersedes the old one.

This follows the pattern established by [Michael Nygard's original
2011 blog post](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
and widely adopted across the software industry.

## Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting at `0001`. Numbers are never
reused.

## Status Values

An ADR is in one of these states:

- `Proposed` — under discussion.
- `Accepted` — the decision has been made.
- `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` — a later ADR replaces this one.
- `Deprecated` — no longer applies but not explicitly superseded.

## Writing a New ADR

Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md), assign the next number, and fill
it in. Commit it in the same PR as the change it documents.
